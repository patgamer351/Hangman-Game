# Hangman-Game
Hello everyone ^o^
The Hangman.cpp will need to be compiled in order to play and if you arent on a windows 10 OS you might need to change the "system("cls")" to whatever on your OS clears the terminal. 
The HangManDecoder.cpp is a work in progress and if you see ways that I can improve it please inform me >~<
Both the Hangman.cpp and the HangManDecoder.cpp read the words.txt file. 
Have a fun time playing the Hangman I created!!
